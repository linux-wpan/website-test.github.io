This project serves the purpose of adding IEEE 802.15.4. and 6LoWPAN support
to the Linux kernel network stack. Direct integration into the kernel stack
allows for using all its capabilities and features.

While the protocol implementation resides inside the mainline Linux kernel, the
needed configuration utilities are some small userspace applications bundled
in a [wpan-tools](wpan-tools) distribution.
